	abstract = {Seven top amateur or professional skateboarders (BW = 713 N ± 83 N) performed Ollie maneuvers onto and off an elevated wooden platform (45.7 cm high). We recorded ground reaction force (GRF) data for three Ollie Up (OU) and Ollie Down (OD) trials per participant. The vertical GRF (VGRF) during the OU has a characteristic propulsive peak (M = 2.22 body weight [BW] ± 0.22) resulting from rapidly rotating the tail of the board into the ground to propel the skater and board up and forward. The anterior-posterior (A-P) GRF also shows a pronounced peak (M = 0.05 ± 0.01 BW) corresponding with this propulsive VGRF peak. The initial phase of landing in the OD shows an impact peak in VGRF rising during the first 30 to 80 ms to a mean of 4.74 ± 0.46 BW. These impact peaks are higher than expected given the relatively short drop of 45.7 cm and crouched body position. But we observed that our participants intentionally affected a firm landing to stabilize the landing position; and the Ollie off the platform raised the center of mass, also contributing to higher forces.},

	abstract = {Collisions between rigid bodies are impulsive events, meaning they create near-instantaneous, finite discontinuities in the velocity state of the dynamic system. If velocity is assumed to be continuous, that requirement may come into conflict with the desire for bodies to not interpenetrate, or with Coulomb friction (creating a condition known as the Painlevé paradox). This letter presents a contact-implicit framework for trajectory optimization using direct collocation that combines an unplanned impulsive contact model with an implicit, high-order numerical integration scheme. We demonstrate that this framework can resolve problems that other implicit formulations cannot, namely elastic or partially elastic collisions, and impacts without collision – the established resolution of the Painlevé paradox. We then evaluate its applicability to legged robotics problems and test its ability to discover the intricate sequence of varied collision types necessary to execute a skateboarding trick.},

When applied to dynamic musculoskeletal models such optimality principles might be used to predict how a patient's gait adapts to mechanical interventions such as prosthetic devices or surgery. In this paper we study the effects of different performance criteria on predicted gait patterns using a 2D musculoskeletal model. The associated optimal control problem for a family of different cost functions was solved utilizing the direct collocation method. It was found that fatigue-like cost functions produced realistic gait, with stance phase knee flexion, as opposed to energy-related cost functions which avoided knee flexion during the stance phase. We conclude that fatigue minimization may be one of the primary optimality principles governing human gait.},

Throughout the paper we illustrate each new set of concepts by working through a sequence of four example problems. We start by using trapezoidal collocation to solve a simple one-dimensional toy problem and work up to using Hermite--Simpson collocation to compute the optimal gait for a bipedal walking robot. Along the way, we cover basic debugging strategies and guidelines for posing well-behaved optimization problems. The paper concludes with a short overview of other methods for trajectory optimization. We also provide an electronic supplement that contains well-documented MATLAB code for all examples and methods presented. Our primary goal is to provide the reader with the resources necessary to understand and successfully implement their own direct collocation methods. (An erratum is attached.)},

Human input is taken to be a torque applied at the ankles. The equations of the nonholonomic rider-board system are presented and a simple tracking task is established. Its dynamics are augmented by those of the skateboard and rider to describe the complete system in the tracking mode. Several control schemes are discussed. Under certain conditions, simple proportional feedback control of rider tilt angle can stabilize roll motion of the vehicle, but in the most general case full state feedback is required. In the complete state feedback case, a performance index for the tracking task is defined and the minimizing feedback gains determined. Time simulations of the tracking task using the optimal feeback gains are shown. Experimental results are presented which tend to validate the theory.},

	abstract = {Background: Correct mastering of a basic Ollie jump is essential for development of other jumps in skateboarding. In scientific literature we can find a lack of scientifically proved knowledge that describes the difference in muscular activity on various levels of this jump performance. Objective: The aim of this study was to characterize muscular activity in the basic skateboard Ollie jump and to compare this activity with a more difficult modification of the switchstance Ollie jump (the same jump but changed position of limbs). Methods: Ten men experienced in skateboarding for several years, aged 20.0 +/- 4.6 years participated in the study (height 1.79 +/- 0.05 m, body mass 71.5 +/- 4.1 kg). All subjects performed 3 measured Ollie jumps and after that 3 switchstance Ollie jumps. In case of the last-mentioned front and back lower limbs are switched. The observation of muscular activity was carried out by the Delsys Trigno electromyography system. The jump was divided (after video records) into four phases: preparatory, take-off, flight-up and landing. Mean amplitude of muscle activity was measured in following muscles: tibialis anterior, gastrocnemius medialis, rectus femoris, semitendinosus and gluteus medius. Comparison of muscle activity during Ollie and switchstance Ollie was performed by the Wilcoxon test in Statistica. Results: Significantly greater activity (p {\textless}.05) was shown by gastrocnemius medialis and rectus femoris on the lower back limb during the preparatory phase of switchstance Ollie and by tibialis anterior and semitendinosus on lower front limb during the landing phase of Ollie. Conclusion: Results of our study suggest that in switchstance Ollie is increased muscle activity during preparation period on the back limb and movement control during landing. The skaters in this type of jump should move his/her centre of gravity from the tail to the centre of the skateboard and also he/she would produce adequate muscle activity also during the landing phase.},

In total, 16 professional and 16 amateur skateboarders were recruited as participants and underwent range of motion assessments, balance testing, and muscle reaction time measurements. The results revealed that professional skateboarders had a significantly smaller inversion angle compared to amateur players, which suggested better joint control and hence greater safety in the former. Balance testing results indicated better balance in professional skateboarders, and healthy skateboarders had better balance than did injured professional and amateur skateboarders.

The tridimensional analysis was captured by eleven cameras (100 Hz) (Vicon (R) system). The analysis of the ollie skateboard maneuver was performed in two different ways: a) without (static maneuver) and b) with (dynamic maneuver) a previous row. The joint angles (ankle, knee and hip), during maximal height center of mass of participants and the skateboard, were compared using the Student's T-test. The correlation between the center of mass of the participant and the skateboard was calculated using the Pearson Correlation. No significant differences were observed in the maximum height of the joint angles and centers of mass of the participants and the skateboard. The maximal height of the participant's and the skateboard's center of mass did not present a significant correlation. The results showed that there is no difference between performing the ollie skateboard maneuver with (static) or without (dynamic) a previous row. However, training to increase the height and improve the performance of the maneuver in general is essential for the skateboarder to achieve a higher score and a greater likelihood of success in sports competitions.},

Researchers recognize that some concepts drawn from biology can be useful in understanding aspects of material culture evolution. Indeed, recent research has demonstrated that material culture can evolve in a branching manner (vertical transmission) similar to that of biological species. However, there are many complicating factors as well, particularly the human penchant for borrowing and resurrecting old ideas resulting in extensive blending and hybridization (lateral transmission). But blending and hybridization occurs in biology as well depending upon the nature and scale of interacting organisms. There is far more lateral information transfer between populations within species than between species (although there are always exceptions). History can also be expected to play a role in the degree to which evolution is affected by vertical versus lateral transmission processes. All things equal, we should expect branching to be most important early in the history of a cultural system since blending could not become significant without the early development of distinct lineages. This is different from most biological systems in the sense that the development of distinct lineages would significantly reduce (or prevent) opportunities for blending. We explore these ideas with an analysis of skateboard decks spanning the history of professional skateboards since 1963. We apply cladistic and networking models in order to develop an understanding of the degree by which skateboard evolution was affected by branching and blending/hybridization processes. The study is enhanced by a historical record that provides significant insight into the actual innovation and borrowing processes associated with skateboard evolution. Results confirm that both branching and blending played important roles and that branching was most critical early in professional skateboard history. The study offers the important implication that while cultural systems will typically incorporate far more horizontal transmission in the evolutionary process (particularly in later stages) than many biological systems, general principles governing early stage branching and disparity may apply to both.},

The dynamic instability affects the steerable wheels of a vehicle and can lead to the loss of control. While for bikes, motorbikes and airplanes the dynamics and causes of the wobble are well known and the literature fully describes the subject, for the skateboard the literature is very poor and there is no paper which investigates this type of instability. In order to do that, the skateboard equations of motion were obtained through Lagrange formalism and Lagrange multipli-ers method was used to solve the non-holonomic constraints. A parametric stability study was carried out on the linearized equations of motion and the influence of different skateboard parameters was investigated. The main discovery is that the wobble doesn't strictly depend on skateboard configuration, but the human control characteristics are predominant in the vehicle dynamics.},

In this paper, we use the ollie, a skateboarding manoeuvre, as case study to develop formulations for a variety of contact types: the elastic collision between the skateboard tail and the ground, the inelastic collision between the wheels and a ground surface with discrete changes in height, and the interaction between the skateboarder's feet and the skateboard - an inelastic, frictional contact that can be applied anywhere on the skateboard's surface. With the exception of the tail-ground interaction, all formulations are unscheduled. The model we developed was able to replicate the key phases of the ollie motion, but comparison of the ground reaction force profiles to those in the literature indicates that further development is necessary for it to be a sufficiently accurate model for biomechanical analysis. The contact models behaved as expected, however, and they could easily be applied to other problems such as robotic motion planning.},

	abstract = {Skateboarding is one of the most popular extreme sports of today. The basic mathematical model, describing the motion of a skateboard with the rider has been proposed by M. Hubbard [1,2]. Recently this model has been developed by A. S. Kuleshov and his co-authors [3-5]. However all these studies don't take into account the rider control of the skateboard i.e. the considered model of the skateboard is incontrollable. The first attempt to introduce the control into this system was made in the paper [2]. This work remains apparently unique study devoted to the skateboard control. In our presentation we discuss various schemes for the control of a skateboard. Obviously it is possible to use the simple feedback control for stabilization of the skateboard with the rider as in [2]. At the same time it is clear that essentially all the degrees of freedom of the system experience hard servo-control on the part of the rider. Therefore we propose the method of control of a skateboard with the help of servo-constraints. The basic ideas on the mechanical systems with servo-constraints have been formulated by H. Beghin [6] and developed by Yu. F. Golubev [7]. In our investigation we essentially used the theory treated in these papers. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {The quantiﬁcation of mechanical power can provide valuable insight into athlete performance because it is the mechanical principle of the rate at which the athlete does work or transfers energy to complete a movement task. Estimates of power are usually limited by the capabilities of measurement systems, resulting in the use of simpliﬁed power models. This review provides a systematic overview of the studies on mechanical power in sports, discussing the application and estimation of mechanical power, the consequences of simpliﬁcations, and the terminology. The mechanical power balance consists of ﬁve parts, where joint power is equal to the sum of kinetic power, gravitational power, environmental power, and frictional power. Structuring literature based on these power components shows that simpliﬁcations in models are done on four levels, single vs multibody models, instantaneous power (IN) versus change in energy (EN), the dimensions of a model (1D, 2D, 3D), and neglecting parts of the mechanical power balance. Quantifying the consequences of simpliﬁcation of power models has only been done for running, and shows differences ranging from 10\% up to 250\% compared to joint power models. Furthermore, inconsistency and imprecision were found in the determination of joint power, resulting from inverse dynamics methods, incorporation of translational joint powers, partitioning in negative and positive work, and power ﬂow between segments. Most inconsistency in terminology was found in the deﬁnition and application of ‘external’ and ‘internal’ work and power. Sport research would beneﬁt from structuring the research on mechanical power in sports and quantifying the result of simpliﬁcations in mechanical power estimations.},

	abstract = {In skateboarding as a sports event, the riders compete in difficulty and completeness of acrobatic motions called “tricks”. As a basic trick, Ollie is performed popularly. However, the basic mechanical principle of the Ollie has not been discussed to date, especially for the Ollie jump (the jumping phase of Ollie). The objective of this study was to elucidate the mechanism of Ollie jump in skateboarding. A simulation model was firstly constructed on a multibody dynamics analysis platform. Next, an experiment using an actual rider was conducted to acquire the motion of the feet during the Ollie jump. By inputting the acquired motion of the feet into the model, a simulation of Ollie jump was carried out. In addition, a parameter study with respect to the geometry of the skateboard and the motion of the rider’s feet was conducted. It was found that the simulated Ollie jump was successful since the skateboard reached a sufficient height and became sufficiently horizontal at the peak height. It was also found that the Ollie jump can be divided into five stages from the mechanical point of view. From the parameter study, it was found that large kick angle of the deck or large distance between two trucks of the deck might cause difficulty in the contact of the tail and the ground, while small kick angle or small distance between two trucks might result in excessive rotating angle of the deck. In addition, three important points for a successful Ollie jump were found to be, to produce sufficiently fast rotational movement of the skateboard around the rear wheels, to separate both feet from the deck before the tail of the deck hits the ground, and to separate the rear foot from the deck at the final stage.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Trajectory optimization with musculoskeletal models can be used to reconstruct measured movements and to predict changes in movements in response to environmental changes. It enables an exhaustive analysis of joint angles, joint moments, ground reaction forces, and muscle forces, among others. However, its application is still limited to simplified problems in two dimensional space or straight motions. The simulation of movements with directional changes, e.g. curved running, requires detailed three dimensional models which lead to a high-dimensional solution space. We extended a full-body three dimensional musculoskeletal model to be specialized for running with directional changes. Model dynamics were implemented implicitly and trajectory optimization problems were solved with direct collocation to enable efficient computation. Standing, straight running, and curved running were simulated starting from a random initial guess to confirm the capabilities of our model and approach: efficacy, tracking and predictive power. Altogether the simulations required 1 h 17 min and corresponded well to the reference data. The prediction of curved running using straight running as tracking data revealed the necessity of avoiding interpenetration of body segments. In summary, the proposed formulation is able to efficiently predict a new motion task while preserving dynamic consistency. Hence, labor-intensive and thus costly experimental studies could be replaced by simulations for movement analysis and virtual product design.},

	abstract = {Skateboarding involves a human controlling a four wheeled vehicle that is steered by tilting the standing surface. The riding mechanics of skateboarding have been well reported [2, 3]. The sport also includes aerial maneuvers such as jumping of stairs, flying off ramps and flipping and rotating the skateboard. The most basic aerial trick is called the ollie. The athlete jumps up while pushing down on the back end of the skateboard’s tail, causing a rotation about the back axle. The upward acceleration due to the rotation together with the tail-ground impact cause the skateboard to go airborne. Midair the athlete drags the skateboard up through frictional contact and levels it out to land the trick. The most concrete performance measure of the ollie is height according to the Olympic judging criteria [4]. To reach maximum height the dynamics such as impact, dynamic response, and torque production are dependent on shape, inertia and mass, which gives reason to assume an optimal shape exists. This leads to the research question: What are the optimal geometric and inertial parameters of a skateboard for an Olympic athlete to reach maximal ollie height. The skateboard geometry is optimized through multiphase direct collocation with the objective of maximal ollie height. A parameterized model is created with scaling mass and inertia properties such that the geometry of the skateboard. Modelling the dynamics of the ollie including impact and friction are done with a point mass human controller that is kineticly and kinematicly mapped to a counter movement jump. A simplistic contact implicit impact scheme is made for a higher order optimization. The ollie height is improved by changing the mass and inertia properties of the skateboard. Multiple optimal board shapes are generated for example a skateboard with a smaller wheelbase can reach higher ollie height compared to an industry standard skateboard.},

	abstract = {SummaryA mesh refinement method is described for solving a continuous-time optimal control problem using collocation at Legendre–Gauss–Radau points. The method allows for changes in both the number of mesh intervals and the degree of the approximating polynomial within a mesh interval. First, a relative error estimate is derived based on the difference between the Lagrange polynomial approximation of the state and a Legendre–Gauss–Radau quadrature integration of the dynamics within a mesh interval. The derived relative error estimate is then used to decide if the degree of the approximating polynomial within a mesh should be increased or if the mesh interval should be divided into subintervals. The degree of the approximating polynomial within a mesh interval is increased if the polynomial degree estimated by the method remains below a maximum allowable degree. Otherwise, the mesh interval is divided into subintervals. The process of refining the mesh is repeated until a specified relative error tolerance is met. Three examples highlight various features of the method and show that the approach is more computationally efficient and produces significantly smaller mesh sizes for a given accuracy tolerance when compared with fixed-order methods.
